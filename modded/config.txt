### OPTIONAL CONFIGURATION ###
#
############ NETWORK ############
#
# SSH [DISABLE, ENABLE]
#   (Disabled by default)
#   (Enable to allow SSH access in attack mode)

# WIFI_SSID [SSID]
# WIFI_PASS [PASS]
#   (Omit WIFI_PASS for open networks)
#   (Omit both WIFI_SSID and WIFI_PASS to disable)
#
# DNS [address 1] [address 2]
#   (Configure DNS servers, applies to both, hosted AP or connect to AP)
#
# WIFI_AP [DISABLE, ENABLE]
#   (Disabled by default)
#   (Enable to host AP instead of connecting to AP)
#   (WIFI_SSID and WIFI_PASS are then used for AP setup instead of connecting to an AP)

# WIFI_HIDE_AP [DISABLE, ENABLE]
#   (Disabled by default)
#   (Enable to hide SSID of AP, e.g. dont broadcast)

# AUTO_ATTACKMODE [ENABLE, DISABLE]
#   (Default is DISABLE)
#   (Choose if ATTACKMODE HID should be issued automatically on boot)
#   (If enabled, a hid keyboard device is present on boot and no manual VID/PID is set from config.txt,
#   hardware properties will be cloned)
#   If disabled, the ATTACKMODE is not set during the boot process. It has to be set in the payloads. This makes
#   attacks more stealth

# MATCHLESS [ENABLE, DISABLE]
#   (Default is ENABLE)
#   (Deactive matchless payload execution, mostly meant for debugging purposes when you want to manually execute them via SSH)

############ DEVICE CONFIG ############
# NOTE: VID AND PID SHOULD BE SET TOGETHER,
# AND WILL DISABLE AUTO VID/PID CLONING
#
# VID [VID_0X<vid hex>]
#
# PID [PID_0X<pid hex>]
#
# MAN [MAN_label]
#
# PROD [PROD_label]
#
# VID VID_0X046A
# PID PID_0X0023

############ PROTECTED ARMING MODE ############
# WARNING: MISCONFIGURATIONS BELOW WILL
# LOCK YOU OUT OF YOUR DEVICE.
#
# ARMING_PASS [password]
# Requires [password] to typed on the keyboard attached to the Key Croc to enter arming mode.
#
# ARMING_TIMEOUT [seconds]
# (OPTIONAL WITH ARMING_PASS) Defining this adds a timeout to the protected arming mode listener
#
# EXAMPLE:
# ARMING_PASS hak5croc
# ARMING_TIMEOUT 5
#
# This configuration will give you 5 seconds to press the button after typing hak5croc on the keyboard
# attached to the Key Croc
#
